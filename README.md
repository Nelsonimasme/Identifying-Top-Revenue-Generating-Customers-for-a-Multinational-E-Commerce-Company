This data science research project presents a comprehensive sales analysis of a leading multinational e-commerce company headquartered in the United States, with operations spanning across North and South America, as well as Europe



# Project Overview
This data science research project presents a comprehensive sales analysis of a leading multinational e-commerce company headquartered in the United States, with operations spanning across North and South America, as well as Europe. 

The objective of the study is to analyze and identify the **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers**, offering critical business insights into customer value, regional sales dynamics, and strategic growth opportunities.

Leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, including data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization, this project uncovers key patterns in customer spending behavior across diverse markets. 

By ranking customers based on total revenue contribution, the analysis empowers business stakeholders with actionable intelligence to optimize customer relationship management, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance profitability in a globally competitive landscape.

This project serves as a practical application of data science principles in the domain of e-commerce, showcasing the impact of data-driven decision-making on strategic business outcomes.

     ### Data Source
     **The Company's central transaction database**

     ### Project Methodology
     - **Data Collection**: Data was collected from the Company's Central Transaction Database

- **Data Pre-processing**: Loaded the data from a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

- **Data Inspection and Cleaning**: Checked for Missing values, Checked for Duplicates.
- - Handled missing values
  - Handled duplicate values

- **Data Modification**: generated some  core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, and would be required for the purpose of the data   analysis

- **Data Aggregation**: To Compute the major metric : Total Revenue by Customer**

- **Data Sorting/ Data Ranking**: To Determine the Most Importat Metric:  **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers**

- **Data Visualization**: To uncover the **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers** in a pictorial form.

- **Data Interpretation**:

- **Key Findings**

- **Conclusions**

- **Recommendation**

### Data Collection
Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`

### Data Pre-processing
**Data Loading**: 
Reading the Raw Dataset which originally existed as a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

__Task:__ Follow the appropriate steps in reading a CSV file into a pandas Dataframe, 

and  Read the data stored  in the csv file named:  `bikes` From your computer.
The resulting Dataframe should be named : `bikes_df`

```python
# solution
import pandas as pd
bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/HP/Downloads/bikes.csv")

bikes_df.head()

```

### Data Inspection and Cleaning

- **1. Check for Missing values**:

```python
# solution 
bikes_df.isna().any()
```

## counting the number of missing values 

### solution 
``` python
total_number_of_missing_values_by_columns = bikes_df.isna().sum()

total_number_of_missing_values_by_columns

```

```python
# visualizing total numbers of missing values

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

total_number_of_missing_values_by_columns.plot(kind = "bar")

# to show yoyr plot
plt.show() 
```

### 2.Handling Missing values:

```python
# solution 

# how to get the most popular value
# solution
bikes_df["ProductColor"].mode()

# bikes_df.fillna()
```

```python
# to veryfiy that there are no more  missing Values

bikes_df.isna().any()
```

- **3. Check for  Duplicates**:

  ```python
# Dropping any duplicates if any exists

# solution

bikes_df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)

  ```

- **4. Handling Duplicates**:

```python
# re-counting our data point again

###solution
len(bikes_df)

# This shows that there was no duplicate in our dataet

```
